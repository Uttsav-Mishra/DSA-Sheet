# 📘 DSA-Sheet: FAANG SDE-2 Prep in Java

This repository contains my structured preparation for **SDE-2 interviews at FAANG-level and top product companies**. I'm solving handpicked problems from **NeetCode 150**, **Striver's SDE Sheet**, and Leetcode core lists — focusing on patterns, clean Java implementation, and long-term consistency.
